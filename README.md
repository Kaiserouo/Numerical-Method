# Numerical Method

Implementation of methods in the book 「數值分析: 使用C語言」 (ISBN: 9865031248).

For (probably) all of the implemented methods and variable names, as well as some notes (in Traditional Chinese), refer to [here](https://hackmd.io/@Kaiserouo/S1hM6gDfF).

## Use
If you want to run codes in `src/` (e.g. `test.py`), with this directory as current working directory, use:

```bash
$ python -m src.test
```
Directly executing the code (e.g. `python test.py`) might not work, since some of the files are dependent to each other.
